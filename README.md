# L3 java project - Efrei

## Objective

The goal was to implement a simplified version of the game dice wars in java.

A first version was to be command line only.

A second one was to offer a graphical interface.

We have also proposed additional features to the original one. 3 types of AI, a game saving by serialization and the possibility to create a new game from the graphical interface without having to restart the game.

## Result

We obtained the maximum score on this project.

## Improvement

A last interesting feature to implement would have been the game in local network then online.

Developed on Intelij IDEA.
